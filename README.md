## Building for source

- Add bin folder to path
- Clone the repository
- Run compile.bat

It should generate a bin folder with an executable file inside every module and install.bat on root folder

### :warning: Antivirus
You may have problems due to antivirus, specifically McAfee.

### Troubleshooting
- The operation could not be started because a required feature is not installed.  
    -> enable virtual machine platform (https://github.com/mars-86/docker-cli/tree/refactor/readme.md#prerequisites).
- Daemon does not starts on init or stops unexpectedly  
    -> go to %USERPROFILE%\docker-cli\daemon\ and run dockerd.exe manually.
- WSL stops instances after windows sleeps (https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/8763)  
    -> go to edit plan settings and change all the options in "choose what the power buttons do" to hibernate also go to "change when the computer sleeps" and set the options under "put the computer to sleep" to never.
